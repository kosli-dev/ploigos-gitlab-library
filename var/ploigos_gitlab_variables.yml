## This file contains variables specific to the implementation of Ploigos on the GitLab CI platform.
## There are two scenarios in which variables will end up here:
##
##   1. The variable cannot be defined uniformly across various CI platforms. For example, the
##      defined workspace of `/home/ploigos` is hard-coded in multiple places as a `mountPath` in
##      the Tekton Helm chart, but the Jenkins library holds that value for reuse in the variable
##      `WORKFLOW_WORKER_WORKSPACE_HOME_PATH`. For the GitLab CI Runner, the `home` variable is
##      used to match the name of the workspace defined for the Tekton workflow.
##
##   2. The variable is specific to GitLab. For example, `GIT_CLONE_PATH` is a GitLab CI variable
##      that determines what directory to checkout to when running a specific job in a pipeline.
##      This ensures that the absolute file path for Ploigos working files within any given pipeline
##      will be the same when moving between different CI Runners.

variables:
  # Clone git repository to a directory that is guaranteed be the same across every job within a
  # single pipeline, but unique to each individual pipeline
  GIT_CLONE_PATH: '$CI_BUILDS_DIR/$CI_PROJECT_NAME-$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH-$CI_PIPELINE_ID'

  # The 'environment' variable is optional for the Ploigos Step Runner (i.e., the `psr` command),
  # and should evaluate to a blank value when not provided. While this works for other CI platforms,
  # the GitLab CI Runner throws an 'unbound variable' error for any undefined variable. To force
  # optional values to evaluate as blank, they must be initialized with an empty value in advance.
  environment: ''

  # Workspace for the container users home directory.
  # Important because the home directory is where the python virtual environment will be setup
  # to be shared with future steps.
  home: '/home/ploigos'

  # Name of the virtual environment to set up in the given home workspace.
  venvName: 'venv-ploigos'
